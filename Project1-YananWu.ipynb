    "With these essential functions in place, we now wish to work towards building a competent AI to play our Connect Square game.  The concept of a <i>heuristic</i> is central to building an AI for most strategy games.  A heuristic is a function that maps a particular game state to a numeric value, indicating how desirable that state is to a particular player.  For example, a game state in which the player is about to win could be assigned a very high heuristic value, while a game state in which the player is about to lose could be assigned a very low value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways in which we can define a heuristic for any particular game, but we will adopt the following approach:\n",
    "- We will consider each overlapping 2 x 2 square within the grid.  For example, the points (0,0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1,1) will represent one square.  (1,0), (1, 1), (2, 0) and (2,1) will represent a second square and so on.\n",
    "- Consider the four points making up each square:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t-  If any one of those points contains an opponent's coin, it will be impossible to win the game by filling this square with our own coins and the square will therefore be assigned a value of 0.  \n",
    "\t- If one of the points contains our coin and the other three are empty the square will be assigned a value of 1. \n",
    "\t- If two of the points contain our coins and the other two points are empty then the square will be assigned a value of 10.\n",
    "\t- If three of the points contain our coins and the other one is empty then the square will be assigned a value of 100.\n",
    "\t- If all four of the points contain our coins then we have won the game and the square will be assigned a value of 1000.\n",
    "- The heuristic value for this game state is the sum of the value of each square in the grid.\n",
    "Note that there are some drawbacks to using this heuristic.  In particular, we don't consider how close our opponent is to completing a square so an AI that uses this heuristic will not try to prevent an opponent from completing his square.  You might like to consider how you could improve upon this heuristic, but for this task you should implement the heuristic as described.  Write a function ``heuristic(board, coin)`` that returns the heuristic value of the ``board`` for the player using the ``coin`` coins.\n",
